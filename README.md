The steps necessary to get a feature done are:
-Talk with the team or the client to get a grasp of the requirements.
-Develop a low-fi to get more clear in the way to advance
-Think in the steps to follow for the development, create a user story and task to implement it
-If the feature is inside of a bigger project create a test to follow the development process, if is not and is the first step in a project we should create a scaffold and from there start preparing the test to guide us in the process.
start the coding, following the errors of our debugger.
when all the tests are passed we can conclude the process.
-Inform the team by creating a pull request, review and refactor in case it is necessary, or request a meeting with the client or whith the person require the feature.
-Merge the pull request and start over with the next feature.
