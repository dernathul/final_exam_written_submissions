The steps necessary to get a feature done are:
-Talk with the team or the client to get a grasp of the requirements.
-Develop a low-fi to get more clear in the way to advance
-Think in the steps to follow for the development, create a user story and task to implement it
-If the feature is inside of a bigger project create a test to follow the development process, if is not and is the first step in a project we should create a Git repository with the scaffold and from there start preparing the test to guide us in the process.
-Create a WIP pull request
-Deploy the app if needed to be able to review the functions with continuos deployment.
-start the coding, following the errors of our debugger.
when all the tests are passed we can conclude the process.
-Inform the team by taking out the WIP status to the pull request, review and refactor in case it is necessary, or request a meeting with the client or whith the person require the feature.
-Merge the pull request and start over with the next feature.
